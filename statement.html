  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Most of my artworks focus on the peace of nature. I enjoy exploring things around my daily life, whether it is from the house or from the street. I use digital programs to create digital images that are tended to relax the viewers, such as landscapes, blossom flowers, or playful animals. Stress and negative energy appear everywhere, thus my main purpose of creating artwork is to help cheering up someoneâ€™s day and myself.</p>
  <p>Often times, I love to shoot photos randomly on the street as for my art inspiration and references. Combining what I see and feel, I am able to express myself using digital programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator to sketch out a fictional illustration inserted with a peaceful emotion.
