    <h3><i>Illusion</i>, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
    <p>The concept I’m trying to reach in my work is a distorted sky landscape. I wanted to create an unnormal sky scene we won’t be able to see in life. Shifting and corrupting the scene to make the overall image pops out was my main purpose for this project. </p>

    <h3><i>Ocean Forest</i>, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
    <p>I came up with a thought of combining ocean and forest together to create an underwater wonderland. The ocean is always full of mysteries and we never know what is down there in the bottom of darkness; there might be a town, a garden, or a forest just like on the land.</p>

    <h3><i>Summer Day</i>, Digital Sound, 2018</h3>
    <p>We always hear sound from the nature, but we never listen to them carefully as we do for music. The environment I wanted to create is a peaceful morning of a summer day; when the sun is about to rise, birds start to chirp. The clock and hand writing sound just allow audiences to imagine their own stories through listening, as they are the one who is sketching the paper and feeling the place.</p>

      <h3><i>Goldfish</i>, Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>My idea of this project is similar to an aquarium but in art installation form. I want to emphasize the vision by installing three large screens and each one displays the different angle. I also used an underwater recording that I found on the web to further expand the atmosphere.</p>

    <h3><i>Space Travel</i>, Interactive Net Art using p5.js, 2018</h3>
    <p>Traveling the space is the main concept of my net art project. I was inspired by an IMAX video I watched years ago, where people are all sitting in front of a super large screen. I thought it would be interesting to insert a few gif that cover the whole screen, that way would make the audiences feel like they are traveling through the universe. </p>

    <h3><i>Spinning Stars</i>, Interactive Net Art using p5.js, 2018</h3>
    <p>This project is mainly focused on shapes and colors. I wanted to keep everything as simple as I can in order to develop a nice and clean website, and I made the stars spinning on different speed to make the overall project look more interesting rather just letting everything sit still. </p>

    <h3><i>Nightmares</i>, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
    <p>The concept I am exploring in this project is to create a series of glitched photos to reflect on some of the nightmares I had before. I don’t use to remember my dreams once I am awaked, but most nightmares were very impressive that I can never forget. I chose to use “photomosh.com” this time because they have more effects that I can use to get the expected results, and lastly Photoshop for minor adjustment.  </p>
